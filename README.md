HelloWorld in Spring MVC 4.

Here is the challenge:

Reduce the code as much as you can by just deleting lines or files, and do not add files, then run "./gradlew jettyRun", you can still see "Hello World!" at http://localhost:8080/springmvc4-helloworld/hello. The person deleted the lines the most wins.
